She has a gothic sense of style—always wearing dark clothes with eyebrow piercings and different colors of streaks in her hair—and is the long-time girlfriend of Beck Oliver. She is very possessive of her boyfriend and is known to lash out at anyone who she views as a threat to their relationship. She shows very little affection for anyone.</div>

She is known as a ditzy, bubbly, cheerful, somewhat dimwitted person who rarely gets angry, although she is very sensitive. She has a playful nature and has a very short attention span, so she can easily be distracted with colorful items by the others when they want her out of the way. She can be somewhat of a drama queen and does not take criticism very well. She often screams "What's that supposed to mean!?" when offended, which is very often and has become her catchphrase. </div>

Because of his talents and good-looks and particularly his fluffy hair, he is very popular with girls (as well as young adult women). He also seems to be very calm, wise, and mature at most times. His talent is acting and can be described as a pretty boy.</div>
